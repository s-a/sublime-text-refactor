Installation
============

Use the Sublime Package Control and search for: "JavaScript Refactor"  
or  
Clone or download the git repository into your packages folder. 
In Sublime Text use "Preferences/Browse Packages" menu item to open this folder. 
The shorter way of doing this is: 
#### Linux
`git clone https://github.com/s-a/sublime-text-refactor.git ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/sublime-text-refactor`

#### Mac
`git clone https://github.com/s-a/sublime-text-refactor.git ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/sublime-text-refactor`

#### Windows
In an elevated command prompt or powershell (as Admin):
`git clone https://github.com/s-a/sublime-text-refactor.git "%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 2\Packages\sublime-text-refactor`"
for Sublime Text 3:
`git clone https://github.com/s-a/sublime-text-refactor.git "%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3\Packages\sublime-text-refactor`"


Dependencies
============
- This Plugin makes heavy usage of Node.js. So it needs a local installation of http://nodejs.org 
- mocha (only for testing)

Usage
=====

***Goto Definition:***  
Select a keyword via double click or point the cursor to the keyword and choose "Goto Definition" from context menu.

***Rename:***  
Select a keyword via double click or point the cursor to the keyword and choose "Rename" from context menu. The plugin will select all variables or function calls occurring in the source code including its declaration. After that you rename them all on the fly. The logic respects the variables or functions scope. So it should be safe to rename them all without thinking ;) .

***Introduce Variable:***  
Select an Expression from source code or point the cursor to the desired position and choose "Introduce Variable" from context menu. 

***Extract Method:***  
Select the source code you want to extract into a new method and choose "Refactor / Extract methode" from context menu. 
This will extract the source code instantly to a new methode aka function. The plugin will manage undeclared variable usages and pass them within a single bundled JSON parameter to the new function.
It also generates a sample function call at the bottom of the new methode.
The plugin marks all variables occurring in the source code so you can rename them on the fly. 


Run the tests
=============
Goto Pluginfolder and type 
    npm test

You can find current test cases here  
https://github.com/s-a/sublime-text-refactor/blob/master/js/test/


Troubleshoot
============
 * Node not found
  * Choose `Preferences: Refactor Settings â€“ User` from context menu and configure the `nodePath` setup. (Default Value is `node`)  


```{
	"nodePath" : "node"
}```


Todo
========================
- ***Extract method***  
- Define exceptions of global scoped variable names like jQuery or $.
- Do not pass variables available in current Scope (optional).
- Let the user choose a function name before or after extraction.
- Let the user choose a custom position to insert extracted methode code and indent it correctly.
